    <h1>A Slow Dawn</h1>
    <div class="credit"> </div>

    <p>I remember, in those early years,<br>
    we spoke with earnest hearts —<br>
    one word was one truth.</p>

    <p>At dawn, by the train station,<br>
    the long street still dark, no footsteps yet.<br>
    A small soybean-milk shop breathing warm steam.</p>

    <p>Back then, sunlight moved slowly.<br>
    Carriages and letters took their time.<br>
    A lifetime was only enough to love one person.</p>

    <p>Even locks were beautiful —<br>
    keys crafted with tenderness and form.<br>
    When you locked the door,<br>
    the world understood.</p>
